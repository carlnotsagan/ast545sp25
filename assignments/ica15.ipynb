    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gravity darkening**, also referred to as gravity brightening, is an astronomical phenomenon where the poles of a star are brighter than the equator, due to rapid rotation and oblate shape. When a star is oblate, it has a larger radius at its equator than it does at its poles. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the poles have a higher surface gravity, and thus higher temperature and pressure is needed to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium. Thus, the poles are \"gravity brightened\", and the equator \"gravity darkened\". - [Wikipedia](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1967ZA.....65...89L/abstract).\n",
