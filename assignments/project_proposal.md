# Project Proposal


## Due Friday, February 21, 2025 | **Total (5% of Final Grade)**


Choose from a list of the following topics:

- Stellar rotation: observational evidence
- Stellar rotation: Von Zeipel theorem
- Stellar rotation: angular momentum transport processes
- From Teff to color: bolometric corrections and extinction
- Asteroseismology
- Cepheids as distance indicators
- Astrometry & the Gaia mission
- Astrometry: walkaway, runaway, and/or hyper-velocity stars
- Astrometric detection of Gaia BH1, BH2, BH3, and NS1
- Tides in stars
- Algol Paradox
- Common envelope evolution
- Mass transfer in binary systems
- Clusters: globular and open
- Globular clusters: dynamics
- Formation of stars
- Stars in galaxies: Chemical evolution
- Stars in galaxies: Mechanical feedback
- Stars in galaxies: Radiative feedback
- Nucleosynthesis: s-process
- Nucleosynthesis: r-process
- X-ray binaries
- Thermonuclear explosion in WDs
- Neutron star structure
- The Eddington limit
- Convective boundary mixing
- Sch√∂nberg-Chandrasekhar limit and its consequences
- Supernova Ia
- Analytic stellar models: Lane-Emden equation
- Analytic stellar models: Eddington standard model
- Novae
- Supermassive stars
- Stellar neutrinos
- Pair instability supernovae
- Triple systems: Kozai-Lidov-von Zeipel oscillations
- Orbital architectures of (star+star) binaries in the Universe
- The lowest mass stars: M dwarfs and Brown dwarfs
- Something else within the scope of the course (to be agreed upon!)
- Combination of topics above (to be agreed upon!)

The topic should be able to be investigated using MESA. One can also supplement with observational data, this is encouraged, but a thorough comparison to a set of MESA models is a **required** component. 


## Project Proposal (1 page)

**Total: (5 points)**

Submit a 1 page PDF, prepared using LaTeX or Markdown, (can include one or two figures, equations etc.) outlining the project motivation, the proposed model set for MESA, expected outcomes of the project. This should be written in prose form. 

## Slides (5 min presentation)

**Total: (5 points)**

Prepare a slide deck to present to the class. Each student will be given 5 minutes to present the contents of the proposed work outlined in the proposal. Turn in slide deck as PDF to D2L. But for presenting you will be able to present in any format.
