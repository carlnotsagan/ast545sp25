    "* in the hottest normal stars - O type - the hydrogen Balmer lines (H$\\beta$, H$\\gamma$, $H\\gamma$, and $H\\epsilon$, etc.) blend with the Pickering series of He II.\n",
    "\n",
    "* With decreasing temperature (later spectral type), the Balmer lines increase in strength, peaking in early A-type stars before rapidly fading away. \n",
    "\n",
    "* in A-type stars, we also begin to see the presence of strong metal lines, lines such as the Ca II K lines, along with other intermediate metals are used to help classify stellar spectra. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Lastly, spectral features due to molecules start to appear in early F-type stars, such as the diatomic molecule CH often called the G-band.\n",
    "\n",
    "* M-type spectra are dominated by strong TiO bands due to their cool atmospheres. \n",

    "In the ideal case, it is the case that you want to classify a star in region of the spectrum where its energy distribution peaks. \n",
    "\n",
    "* For hot O- and B-type stars this is typically in the ultraviolet (UV).\n",
    "* A- through K-type stars in the optical (shown above). \n",
    "* And M-type and later in the red and infrared. \n",

    "#### Spectroscopic Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Neutral atom of Ne is given as Ne I, with the singly ionzed Ne would be Ne II and so on. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Positive Luminosity Effect**: Define as a spectral feature that _increases_ in strength with increasing luminosity class - V to III to I. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Negative Luminosity Effect**: Conversely, if a spectral feature _decreases_ in strength with increasing luminosity class. One example being the hydrogen lines in early A-type stars which peak near this type. \n",

    "## Multi-color Photometry and Stellar Classification\n",

    "\n",
    "> A combination of methods are often the best possible means of classification. Photometry can measure continuum features in a stellar spectrum, such as the slope of the Paschen continuum, the Balmer jump. While Spectral Classification often relies on the appearance of the line spectrum. "
