    "Let us first point out two main differences between the properties of low- and intermediate-mass stars discussed previously. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Massive stars reach temperatures of $T\\gt 5\\times10^{8}$ K, allowing them to ignite Carbon under **non-degenerate** conditions. Thus, a critical CO core mass ($\\approx 1.06$) is required to reach these ignition conditions, this critical mass is usually reached for stars with initial mass greater than $\\approx 8 M_{\\odot}$ but this is subject to uncertainties in mixing etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Stars with initial mass greater than $\\approx 11 M_{\\odot}$ will go on to burn elements heavier than Carbon up to the formation of an iron core. The following discussion will focus on those stars with $M_{\\rm{ZAMS}}\\gt \\approx 11 M_{\\odot}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For stars with initial mass greater than $\\approx 15 M_{\\odot}$ **mass loss by stellar winds** becomes of significant importance. At $M_{\\rm{ZAMS}}\\gt \\approx 30 M_{\\odot}$, the mass loss timescale ($\\tau_{ml}=M/\\dot{M}$) can become comparable to the nuclear timescale.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Empirical rates suggest about 1/3 to 1/6 of the momentum is actually transferred. We can also observe an acceleration of the wind facilitated by the Doppler broadening of the spectral lines that allows the outflowing atoms to then be able to absorb photons at a different, higher frequency leading to a positive feedback mechanism driving the wind. \n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainties due to inhomogeneuous clumping can also effect rate estimates by factors up to about 3. Moreover, the mass loss rate is found to have a dependence on the metallicity of the star, due to the heavier elements being the main elements that contribute to the line driving\n",

    "\n",
    "Red Supergiants are cool, luminous stars that experience slow but significant mass loss similar to the AGB superwinds -- driven by a combination of radial stellar pulsations and radiation pressure on dust particles in the cool atmosphere. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stars with $12M _{\\odot} \\gt M \\lt 40 M{\\odot}$ spend a large fraction of their core He-burning evolution as RSG losing part of their H-envelope. In this case of complete removal of the H-envelope, the He-core is exposed as a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star. \n",
