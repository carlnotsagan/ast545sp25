    "Stellar pulsations start from _pressure waves_ (sound waves that resonate in the stellar interior). \n",
    "\n",
    "These radial oscillations act like standing waves with a node at the center and open end at the surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Fundamental mode** - one node at the center\n",
    "\n",
    "**First overtone** - one node at the center and one between center and surface\n",
    "\n",
    "**Second overtone** - one node at the center and two between center and surface\n",
    "\n",
    "Most radially pulsating stars, _Cephieds_, are oscillating in their fundemental mode. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adiabatic Oscillations\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, oscillations will be a about some equilibrium structure at equilibrium radius $r_{0}$ and mass $m$. Under these assumptions, the radial oscillation frequency is found to be: \n",

    "\n",
    "For $\\gamma_{\\rm{ad}}<4/3$, we have $\\omega^{2}<0$, indicating exponential growth of the perturbations and **dynamical instability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we average $\\omega$ over the entire star, we can get an estimate for the **pulsation frequency of the fundamental mode**:\n",

    "### Driving and damping of pulsations\n",
    "\n",
    "**$\\epsilon$-mechanism**:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the compressed region occurs where nuclear reactions occur, $T$ rises and thus the nuclear energy generation rate. This could satisfy the criterion to grow the pulsation. Always taking place in the cores, but very small amplitudes. Might be important for very massive stars, not so for Cepheids. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**$\\kappa$-mechanism**: \n",
    "\n",
    "If the compressed layer becomes more opaque, heat is trapped. This causes and increase in $P$ and $T$, which drive expansion and release of the heat as a result of the reduction of opacity. This can maintain the pulsation cycle and drive large scale pulsations. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can write a requirement for this mechanism as:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "for pulsations via this mechanism we require $\\kappa_{P} + \\kappa_{T} \\nabla_{\\rm{ad}}\\gt0$.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Pathways to Instability\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **$\\kappa_{T}>0$**, occurs when $H^{-}$ opacity dominates in very cool stars with $T\\lt10^{4}(\\rm{K})$. Cepheids are too hot for this. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Small $\\nabla_{\\rm{ad}}$ for a Kramers like opacity. We found that $\\nabla_{\\rm{ad}}$ can be reduced in _partial ionization zones_. \n",
    "\n",
    "    **Two key partial ionization zones**\n",
    "    - $T\\approx1.5\\times10^{4}$ - where $H\\rightarrow H^{+}+e^{-}$ and $He\\rightarrow He^{+}+e^{-}$ can occur. \n",
    "    - $T\\approx4\\times10^{4}$ - where helium becomes doubly ionized $He^{+}\\rightarrow He^{++}+e^{-}$ (more opaque)\n",
    "    \n",
    "These considerations determine the location of the instability strip.\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: Cepheids**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The main gas involved is thought to be helium. The cycle is driven by the fact doubly ionized helium, the form adopted at high temperatures, is more opaque than singly ionized helium. \n",

    "1. Outer layer is compressed\n",
    "2. This layer is heated, helium is doubly ionized\n",
    "3. The increased heat absorbs enough heat to expand\n",
    "4. Cools and Helium is back to singly ionized (less opaque)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cepheid variables become dimmest during the part of the cycle when the helium is doubly ionized.\n",
