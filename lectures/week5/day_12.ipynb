    "The interiors of Jupiter and Saturn are modeled assuming the existence of a **distinct heavy-element core** which is surrounded by an envelope divided into an **inner helium and heavy element-rich layer** and an **outer envelope which is helium poor and less enriched with heavy elements**. For a review on these details see [Fortney and Nettelmann 2010](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.0533).\n",
    "\n",
    "Helium rain, the condensation of helium into droplets and leading to the relase of latent heat has been proposed to explain Saturn's high thermal emssion. But, these and other details of the interior rely on the exact location which He rain other other conditions occur. \n",

The red curve shows the critical temperature for that separation according to Morales et al. (2013). Numerical and experimental results by Schouten et al. (1991) and Loubeyre et al. (1991) are also presented. The back curves show the isentropes of Jupiter (plain) and Saturn (dashed), respectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "Recently, new estimates for Jupiter’s gravitational field were determined by the Juno spacecraft (Bolton et al. 2017). Interior models of Jupiter that fit thedata suggest that another feasible solution for Jupiter is the existence of a **diluted core**. \n",

    "Jupiter’s core is no longer viewed as a pureheavy-element central region with a density discontinuity at the core-envelope boundary, but as a diluted core which is a more extended region, and can also consist of lighter elements.\n",

Requires the entropy to be stably stratified ($\\nabla-\\nabla_{\\rm{ad}}$<0, non-convective) but the composition gradient is unstably stratified ($\\nabla_{\\mu}$<0).\n",
