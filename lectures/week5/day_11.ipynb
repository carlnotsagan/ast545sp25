    "Similar to heat transport via radiation, we require a temperature gradient. However, there is a limit to the possible temperature gradient that would be required for some luminosity values. If this limit is exceed then an instability sets in, leading cyclic macroscopic motions of the gas, known as _convection_.\n",

    "2. the blob expands adiabatically (no heat exchange $\\textrm{d}q=0$) to maintain pressure equilibrium with its surroundings. $P_{2}=P_{\\rm{equilibrium}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If $\\rho_{2} > \\rho_{\\rm{equilibrium}}$** - the blob will sink back down to position 1. \n",

    "**If $\\rho_{2} < \\rho_{\\rm{equilibrium}}$** - buoyancy forces will accelerate it upwards, convection occurs.\n",

    "# The Mixing Length Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Stellar fluid comprised of _parcels_, _eddies_, _elements_, _bubbles_, or _blobs_ that can move from regions of high heat to regions of lower heat content. These blobs are capable of transporting or convecting heat through the fluid. MLT is a _local_ theory. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions in the MLT \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A readily identifiable parcel has a characteristic dimension of the same order of size as the mixing length $\\ell$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The mixing length is **much shorter** than any scale length associated with the structure of the star -- such as the pressure scale height, $H_{\\rm{P}}$ or $\\lambda_{\\rm{P}}$. In practice, $\\ell \\sim H_{\\rm{P}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The parcel always has the same internal pressure as that of its surroundings.\n",

    "4. Acoustic phenomena may be ignored altogether, as may shocks, etc.\n",

    "5. Temperatures and densities within and outside a parcel differ by only a small amount\n",

    "1. A star in which nuclear burning occurs in a convective core will homogenize the region inside the core\n",
    "2. A star with a deep convective envelope, such that it extends into regions where nuclear burning has taken place, will mix the burning products outwards towards the surface. This processed is called the **dredge-up**.\n",

    "### Convective Overshoot\n",
    "\n",
    "When a convective blob crosses the boundary of the convective region, it will have a non-zero velocity. On average, some blobs will overshoot this boundary and extend beyond the boundary defined by the criterion. \n",
