    "The fractions by which various detection methods contributed to the accumulated sample of known planets are shown, for years since 1995. At the end of 1995, only five planets were known, three from pulsar timing and two from radial velocities. Between 1996 and 2013, the sample of known planets was dominated by those discovered with radial velocities, while in 2018, 78% of all known planets had been discovered by transits. Based on data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive in Feb. 2018, and using its classification by discovery methods . \n",

    "\n",
    "The key idea behind transmission spectroscopy is that the planet’s transit depth is wavelength dependent. \n",
    "\n",
    "At wavelengths where the atmosphere is more opaque due to absorption by atoms or molecules, the planet blocks slightly more stellar flux. \n",
    "\n",
    "To measure these variations, the light curve is binned in wavelength into spectrophotometric channels, and the light curve from each channel is fit separately with a transit model. The measured transit depths as a function of wavelength constitute the transmission spectrum, so named because the variation arises from the transmission of stellar flux through the planet’s atmosphere. \n",

    "Theoretical models of the atmosphere require radiative transfer simulations, but we can make an order of magnitude estimate. First we define the atmospheric scale height, $H$, as the change in altitude over which the pressure drops by a factor of $e$. Combining the assumptions of HSE and ideal gas law,\n",

    "where $n$ is the number of scale heights crossed at wavelengths with high opacity (typically around two for cloud-free atmospheres at low spectral resolution; Stevenson 2016). It follows that ideal candidates for transmission spectroscopy have high equilibrium temperatures, small host stars, low surface gravity, and low mean molecular mass composition (hydrogen dominated). \n",

In dwarf stars this means that we see apparently darker regions to the apparent limb than in the apparent center of the star.\n",

All transit light curveswere produced with the same temperature, metallicity, logg, and microturbulent velocity and for the same Kepler photometric passband.\n",
