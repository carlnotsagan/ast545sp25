    "Let's start with a $1 M_{\\odot}$ star as an example:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. the burning is _unstable_ that is, it causes a temperature **increase** instead of decrease leading to _thermonuclear runaway_.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This is because the electron degeneracy pressure is basically independent of $T$ so the ignition doesnt change the pressure and hence the corresponding work done in a normal stable burning event. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Therefore, the nuclear energy goes into raising the internal energy of the _ions_ leading to an increase of the temperature, but **not** an increase in the density of the gas - dictacted by the degenerate electrons. The evolution of the material is therefore nearly _vertically upward_ in the $\\rho_{c},T_{c}$ diagram. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. the thermonuclear runaway leads to a main helium flash producing a local luminosity of $l \\approx 10^{10} L_{\\odot}$ - similar to a small galaxy, but lasting for only a few seconds. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Stellar models suggest a series of flashes occur until the core has sufficient expanded, degeneracy is lifted and burning proceeds in a stable convective core fashion. \n",
