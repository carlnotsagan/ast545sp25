    "### Weak Interactions\n",

    "Because of the strong $T$ and $\\rho$ dependence on different reactions, it is important to also consider the half-life of the nuclei in question.\n",

    "and the decay may be the more likley channel. At higher temperatures and densities where the resonant component can contribute, and the capture reaction is comparable to the beta decay timescale. \n",
