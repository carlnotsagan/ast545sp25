    "\n",
    "1. The pressure of the completely degenerate but nonrelativistic electron gas goes as $\\rho^{5/3}$. Hence, by the definition of the polytropic equation of state (7.16), $n$ for this case is 1.5 (or “a three-halves polytrope”).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The density exponent for the fully relativistic case is 4/3 and thus $n = 3$ (or “an n equal three polytrope”).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Recall that $P\\propto\\rho^{5/3}$ in an ideal gas convection zone. If no ionization is taking place (almost a contradiction for a real convection zone) then $\\Gamma_{2} = 5/3$ and $n = 3/2$ again.\n",
    "\n",
