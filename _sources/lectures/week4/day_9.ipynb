    "The current spectral classification scheme was developed at Harvard Observatory in the early 20th century. Work was begun by Henry Draper who photographed the first spectrum of Vega in 1872. After his death, his wife donated the equipment and a sum of money to the Observatory to continue his work. The bulk of the classification work was done by **Annie Jump Cannon** from 1918 to 1924. The original scheme used capital letters running alphabetically, but subsequent revisions have reduced this as stellar evolution and typing has become better understood. The work was published in the Henry Draper Catalogue (HD) and Henry Draper Extension (HDE) which contained spectra of 225,000 stars down to ninth magnitude.\n",

    "**O star** - strong HeII (second ionization) lines of helium. Since the ionization potential is high, such stars are the hottest in terms of effective temperature.\n",

    "**B star** - Spectral type “B” stars show strong HeI plus some HI lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A to F star** - The Balmer lines (spectral line emissions of the hydrogen atom) reach their peak in the “A” stars and begin to disappear in “F”. \n",

    "**L star** - Spectra show strong metal-hydride molecular bands (CrH & FeH), and neutral metals, but TiO and VO bands are nearly absent.\n",

    "For the stationary case, $\\nu_{0}$ is the photon frequency necessary to promote an electron to a particular higher state and $\\gamma$ is the sum of the damping constants for the two levels involved.\n",
