    "# Evolution in Close Binary Systems \n",
    "\n",
    "We define a **close binary system** as one containing two stars in which the evolution of either star is strongly influenced by the presence of the other. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most stars are in binaries (or multiples) and of that, half are close binary systems. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Defitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $a$ - semi-major axis of the system\n",
    "2. $q$ - mass ratio ($M_{1}/M_{2}$), where $M_{1}$ is the primary (or \"donor\") star.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Roche Lobe\n",
    "region around a star in a binary system within which orbiting material is gravitationally bound to that star. It is an approximately teardrop-shaped region bounded by a critical gravitational equipotential, with the apex of the teardrop pointing towards the other star (the apex is at the L1 Lagrangian (points of equilibrium for small-mass objects under the gravitational influence of two massive orbiting bodies) point of the system).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mass Transfer\n",
    "\n",
    "When a star \"exceeds its Roche lobe\", its surface extends out beyond its Roche lobe and the material which lies outside the Roche lobe can \"fall off\" into the other object's Roche lobe via the first Lagrangian point. In binary evolution this is referred to as mass transfer via Roche-lobe overflow.\n",
