    "## Common Envelope Onset and Evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common-envelope** Evolution occurs when the companion of the mass-losing star becomes engulfed by the envelope of the donor. CEE can be initiated by two main circumstances:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **dynamically unstable mass transfer** - when the donor cannot shrink fast enough to stay within its Roche lobe\n",
    "    - occurs when the donor has a deep convective envelope (late case B and case C) and is of similar mass or more massive than its companion, \n",
    "    - **or** when the donor has a radiative envelope (early case B) but is much more massive than its companion, by a factor >∼ 4 -- high $q=M_{d}/M_{a}=M_{2}/M_{1}$.\n",
    "2. when the **spin angular momentum is more than ~1/3 times the orbital angular momentum**, which causes tidal interaction to become unstable and the companion is literally dragged into the donor’s envelope by tidal forces.\n",
    "    - can occur when the mass ratio is very large, large $q$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Okay, so you might be wondering how I got myself in this situation -- what happens to the companion??\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the companion is inside the donor’s envelope:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the friction between the motion of the companion and the envelope removes angular momentum from the orbital motion, and releases energy\n",
    "2. the orbit shrinks, and the envelope is brought into rotation and heated\n",
    "3. This process continues until enough energy is added to the envelope to expel it.\n",
    "\n",
    "OR, \n",
    "\n",
    "4. the companion star may spiral-in until it merges with the core of the mass donor\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
