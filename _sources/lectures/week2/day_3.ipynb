    "\n",
    "   1. Because of the high total luminosity, the interior of a nonaccreting hydrostatic protostellar model is **convective**.\n",
    "   2. For fully convective stars, it is not possible to build a hydrostatic model if the temperature falls below a certain value,thus there is a \"forbidden region\" in the H-R diagram.\n",
    "   3. The boundary of this forbidden region is almost vertical for a given mass star, so that as a star contracts it evolves at roughly constant effective temparture.\n",
    "   \n",
    "This _forbidden region_ is known as the [**Hayashi track**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayashi_track).\n",
    "\n",
    "A protostar leaves the Hayashi track when it either deviates to the [_Henyey track_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henyey_track) or nuclear fusion occurs and the star reaches the main sequence. \n",
    "This differences are all reliant of the initial mass of the star.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example HR diagram from [Stahler 1988](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1988ApJ...332..804S/abstract) showing low mass stellar evolution tracks along the Hayashi and Henyey tracks until reaching the Main Sequence:\n",

    "1. chemically homogeneous with identical or very similar compositions\n",
    "2. hydrostatic and thermal balance\n",
    "3. energy is derived solely from nuclear burning\n",

    "We can also define the **Zero-Age Main-Sequence** (ZAMS) as the time at which the stellar model satisfies these requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Key takeaway:** ZAMS solutions for stars with identical mass or composition in stellar modeling are not unique due to many uncertainties from: equations of state, opacities, and nuclear generation rates. We will discuss all of these in more detail in later chapters. "

    "Evolution off of the main sequence will depend on the initial mass. Lets categorize them as follows:\n",

    "### **Unevolved Lower ZAMS:** \n",
    "Using HKT Eq. 1.88 $t_{\\rm{nuc}}\\approx 10^{10}\\left ( \\frac{M}{M_{\\odot}} \\right )^{-2.5} \\geq 17$ Gyr, greater than a Hubble time for stars $lt$ 0.8$M_{\\odot}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lower:**\n",
    "Mass range of $\\approx0.8-1.0M_{\\odot}$ to $\\approx2.0-2.3M_{\\odot}$ depending on composition. These mass ranges undergo helium ignition in the electron degenerate regime (they are to the right of the $\\epsilon_{\\rm{F}}/kT=10$). Models to the left are non-degenerate and obey ideal gas laws. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Intermediate:**\n",
    "At mass ranges of about 3$M_{\\odot}$ to about 8-9$M_{\\odot}$ helium ignition occurs in a nondegenerate scenario leading to the build up of a primarily **degenerate** carbon ($^{12}$C) and ($^{16}$O) core. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Upper (aka Massive):**\n",
    "Stars about $9M_{\\odot}$ or greater. The main distinction being from intermediate masses being that a **non-degenerate** CO core is formed and maintained until C-ignition. \n",

    "![Evolution of Single Stars Off the Main Sequence in T-Rho](post_ms.jpg)\n",

    "Evolution of stars off of the main sequence for three stellar tracks. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. For all the stellar tracks shown below (except the massive star model of 15$M_{\\odot}$), hydrogen depletion/growth of the _helium_ core is surrounded by an active H-burning shell which provides a power source.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The helium core continues to contract, due to the lack of a burning source. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The contraction and heating of the He-core and the H-shell drives expansion of the stellar envelope. The star becomes evolve towards the red giant branch (3-6). \n",
    "\n",
    "Where the **red giant branch (RGB)** is characterized by a continual expansion and reddening of the star to lower effective temperatures.\n",
