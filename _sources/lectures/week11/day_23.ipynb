    "We can identify three unique physically motivated regions of the BH mass distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "**From lowest mass to highest mass:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first boundary is set by the maximum allowed mass of a neutron star. Recall this is EoS dependent. $M_{ZAMS} ~ 20M_{\\odot}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, is electron–positron pair production regime. Stars with initial mass of $\\gt\\sim100M_{\\odot}$ can have $T_{c}\\gt7\\times10^{8}$ (K). This allows for the production of electron–positron pairs from photons via the $\\gamma + \\gamma \\rightarrow e^{-} + e^{+}$, the net result being $\\Gamma_1<4/3$ in some regions and the core becoming dynamically unstable prior to O-ignition. This leads to a Pulsational Pair Instability Supernova (PPISN) and eventually a black hole. $M_{ZAMS} ~ 100M_{\\odot}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The next boundary, which also defines the peak of the stellar black hole spectrum, is defined by the point at which the pulse initiated by the pair-instability that it completely unbinds the star and no remnant is left behind. This defines the lower limit of the **black hole mass gap**. $M_{ZAMS} ~ 130M_{\\odot}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The next boundary is at $M_{ZAMS} ~ 250M_{\\odot}$ where the core can reach temperatures of $T_{c}\\gt6\\times10^{9}$ K and endothermic photodisintegration becomes efficient at absorbing energy and preventing the unbinding of the star until reaching CC and eventually BH formation. \n",
