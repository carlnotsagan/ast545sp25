    "\n",
    "Some general caveats: Star-formation is not very well understood compared to stellar evolution. Key uncertainties still lie in the resulting: \n",
    "\n",
    "**star formation efficiency:** the fraction of gas of the interstellar cloud that is turned into stars,\n",
    "\n",
    "and the\n",
    "\n",
    "**initial mass function:** the spectrum and relative probability of stellar masses that are formed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever possible, we use observational efforts to constrain this and many other uncertainties in star formation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations demonstrate that stars are formed out of molecular clouds, typcially \n",
    "\n",
    "**giant molecular clouds**:\n",
    "    - masses $\\mathcal{O}(\\sim10^{5}M_{\\odot})$\n",
    "    - about 10 parsecs in size\n",
    "    - 10 - 100 K\n",
    "    - densitities of $\\sim$ 10-300 molecules $cm^{-3}$.\n",
    "    - few percent of dust, causing them to be very opaque to visible\n",

    "We can describe approximately six stages of Star Formation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interstellar cloud collapse\n",
    "Star formation stars with a perturbation: a nearby shock or collision moving the cloud out of HSe and inducing collapse under its own gravity. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can define a critical mass known as the **Jeans mass**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Jeans mass** concerns the mass involved in such a perturbation. Should the mass involved be **less** than the Jean's mass then the cloud can maintain pressure equilibrium. If not, the filiments will undergo free-fall collapse described by the dynamical timescale, $\\tau_{\\rm{dyn}} \\sim \\rho^{-1/2}$. However, since the densities are so low, this timescale on the order of millions of years. \n",

    "## Cloud fragmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "As the density of the collapsing material increases, the **Jeans mass** decreases. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Due to the local violation, the cloud begins to fragment into small pieces, which individually continue to collapse until mass of smallest fragments is less than about $0.1M_{\\odot}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formation of a protostellar core\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking now to only the _collapsing cloud fragment_, as the density continues to increase, the gas becomes **opaque** to infrared photons. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The result is that the radiation is trapped in the causing heating and increase in gas pressure that slows dynamical collapse and the and the fragment comes into HSE. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The fragment continues in HSE and quasi-static contraction. \n",

    "A **protostar** is born!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accretion\n",
    "\n",
    "The next phase is dominated by accretion as gas continues to fall onto the protostar. Due to conservation of angular momentum, the accretion leads to the formation of an accretion disk. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Accretion disks** are commonplace in the star-formation process and observed around most younf stars, primarily in inrared and submillimeter wavelengths. \n",

    "\n",
    "As the protostellar core continues to contract the gas behaves like an ideal gas. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. However, at $T\\sim2000$ K molecular hydrogen starts to disassociate, and HSE is again lost and dynamical collapse begins again. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Once $H_{2}$ is fully disassociated into atomic H, HSE is restored. \n",
    "\n",
