    "\n",
    "1. The metallicity of the host star is representative of the primordial cloud from which it formed. \n",
    "2. Implying that in a high-metallicity protoplanetary disk, giant planets form more easily. \n",

    "1. the formation of giant planets begins with a rocky/icy core (10–15 $M_{\\oplus}$)\n",
    "2. gas is accreted onto the core in a runaway process, until it has cleared its orbit or the gas is removed from the disk. \n",

[Osborn & Bayliss, 2019](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/491/3/4481/5628339). Less massive planets (sub-Neptune) show a wider range of distributions accross metallicity. \n",
