1. HKT Problem 4.2 (30 points)


    
2. HKT Problem 4.10 (30 points - 10 each part)

    
3. Exploring Radiative and Convective Zones in MESA (see. HKT 3.7, 4.2, 5.1). Run a 1Msun model to the start of the WD cooling phase saving profiles throughout the evolution then (30 points - 15 each part):

    - pick two different time snapshots (profile files) to compare the logarithmic temperature/density/pressure gradients. Make plots comparing $\nabla_{actual}$, $\nabla_{ad}$, $\nabla_{rad}$, and to find regions of the star that are radiative versus convective.
    - If the stars were composed on an ideal gas following a γ law equation of state, what values would you expect these to approach (i.e. identify reasonable choice of γ to get an analytic estimate).
