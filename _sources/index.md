## Getting Started

Below are some details about getting started with some of the tools and resources we will be using throughout the semester.

### Conda programming environemt

Throughout this course we will be using various python tools and packages. [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) is a package manager that allows you to create environments for downloading all the packages you need without disrupting (usually) the existing computing `env` you are using. 

Please download the appropriate `conda` environment for your machine, create an environment for this class, and install a few starting packages including:

```
conda install anaconda::jupyter
```
